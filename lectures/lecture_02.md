## How to create a homepage on github

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name <your-username>.github.io. Note that <your-username> should be replaced with your actual GitHub username.
2. Go to the Settings tab of the newly created repository and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
3. Select the main branch as the source and click Save.
4. Create an index.html file in the repository. This will serve as your homepage. You can also add other files like CSS and JavaScript files as needed.
5. Commit the changes to the repository and push them to the main branch.
6. Wait for a few minutes and then visit <your-username>.github.io in your web browser. Your new homepage should now be live!
